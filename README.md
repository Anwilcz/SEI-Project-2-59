## Overview

The project aim was to build a multi-view React application that consumes a public API. This React application allows navigation to different views through React router library and handles URL's endpoints by matching them with respective components.

My contribution to this project focused on pulling data from a CoinStats API by building URL Axios requests based on existing API documentation, processing a JSON data object received in a server response, and building React JSX components to render the information in the browser. I have also implemented a filter bar that allows selecting the scope of data matching the search or sort conditions.
